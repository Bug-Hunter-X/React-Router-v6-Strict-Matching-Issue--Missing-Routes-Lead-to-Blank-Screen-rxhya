```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ... other routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return <div>Home</div>;
}

function About() {
  return <div>About</div>;
}

export default App;
```
This code uses the `BrowserRouter` and nested `Routes` and `Route` components to define routes.  However, the bug arises when attempting to navigate to a route that doesn't exist.  React Router v6 uses a strict matching system, and it will not match a partial URL.  This can lead to the app rendering nothing or getting stuck in a loading state.
